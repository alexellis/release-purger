## release-purger

A tool to remove the binary releases from projects which are taken for granted.

What's the problem being solved? Despite sponsorships or a paid version being made available, there's over 157k recent downloads of inlets OSS, and over 8.3k GitHub Stars. How many sponsors? (today it's 1, at 25 USD / mo)

What's the solution? By removing the binary releases, the open source version becomes less useful vs. the commercial option, which is priced at the cost of a mid-level GitHub Sponsorship.
