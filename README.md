## release-purger

A tool to remove the binary releases from projects which are taken for granted.

What's the problem being solved? Despite sponsorships or a paid version being made available, there's over 157k recent downloads of [inlets OSS](https://github.com/inlets/inlets), and over 8.3k GitHub Stars.

[How many sponsors are there?](https://github.com/sponsors/inlets) (today it's 1, at 25 USD / mo) by the time you are reading this, it may be zero.

What's the solution? By removing the binary releases, the open source version becomes less useful vs. the commercial option, which is priced at the cost of a mid-level GitHub Sponsorship.
